Assortment of MATLAB scripts for both of my numerical analyses classes. Topics covered within the course I: root finding and fixed points, polynomial interpolation, splines, numerical integration and numerical differentiation. Topics covered within course II: numerical solution of ordinary differential equation, the heat and wave equations, and moving interfaces. The discussed techniques include implicit schemes or ODEs, finite differences, spectral methods and the level set method.

# Brick-Breaker
One of my first programs ever, created as a final project for my physics freshman intro course. I recreated my own version of brick breaker with questionable physics. I might come back to this one day and reoptimize the code to something that wasn't written by someone who'd been coding for less than two months.

The code did have the functionality to restart by clicking on the screen after you lost, but that has been lost with the updates to Python 3+ and Vpython 7+. If you still use Python 2 and Vpython 6, it might work again. The only changes made at the time of submission were those to make the program work with the latest versions of Python and Vpython.

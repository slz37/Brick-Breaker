Homework scripts for my optimization theory class. Mainly focuses on solutions to linear problems, the simplex method (both phase I and II), duality theory (including KKT conditions), and a bit of game theory at the end. The class followed the textbook: Linear Programming with MATLAB by Michael C. Ferris, Olvi L. Mangasarian, and Stephen J. Wright.

An interesting problem given as homework during my Cosmology course. The program reads a file containing a given density fluctuation field in the format: x y delta

In part A, the code first plots the field by itself, coloring by delta. 

In part B, a supergrid is created such that the "universe" loops back around on itself. Then circles of varying radii are placed at random. Within each circle, the mass is calculated, and the code finally calculates the real space density. It repeats this up to a radii of 16 and plots the density vs the radii. There is the option to save the images for every sample for each radii and write these to a gif.

In part C, the code computes the power spectrum of the delta and plots it on a log-log plot. Currently, I am certain this part is incorrect, but I am still thinking how to get it to work.

The output folders above each contain the plots from the three parts and the gifs for each radii of the sample areas placed.
